What makes our wireframe different from others?
	•	Since it is in HTML5 then we can re-use the code to make it into a website. Instead of viewing what your webpage would look like, it would actually implement a webpage.
You must define the Wireframe tool that you think you could build in this class (be cautious)

You should discuss the general reason the tool exists.

You should discuss the people it is built for (users – remember them?)

You should discuss what you think they (the users) would use the tool for and why

	•	user can this tool to create a layout of a webpage
	•	user can also add some animations in order to demonstrate how the actual webpage should be developed
	•	

You should discuss the features of the tool
	- See List


You should present a picture (or even a Web page) that visually describes the tool
	- To Be Done


You should discuss any worries, concerns, limitations, etc. that you have about the tool and its production
	•	time 
	•	only limited to 5 weeks.
	•	Concern to not have much animation
	•	Worried that we will be doing the programmers part
	•	Not too detailed
	•	Worried we will take from the graphic designer job
