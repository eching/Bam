		<b>Basic Functions.</b> Our focus is on the simplest element for a wireframe tool: drag and drop into a canvas. We first will implement the ability to drag, drop, and move a simple element onto a canvas. Afterwards, we will focus on implementing resizing, selecting, and deleting the object(s) on the canvas
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<p>
		<b>Basic Elements.</b> In this phase, we will be creating our library of elements. By the end of this phase, users should be able to add the simple elements to their canvas and do simple edits to these elements; such as, the ability to edit a text box or the name of a button.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<p>
		<b>Utilities.</b> We are going to add additional functionalities such as copy, paste, select all, undo, redo, etc. With these functionalities, it makes editing easier and more efficient.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<p>
		<b>Element Builder.</b> This feature allows user to add elements to our library. It will help users build more complex elements which serves as a their own "shortcuts" when designing their webpage.
	</p>
	<br />
	
	<p>
		<b>Interactions.</b> This feather will allow a user to control the behavior of their webpage base on the different events that are happening or the different state which the page may be in. This will mirror effects created in javascript such as: a button changing color when hovered over, or a different page layout upon user being logged in or not.

			<UL>
			<LI><h3>Time</h3>
				<UL>
				<LI>Being limited to build BAM!&copy; in 5 weeks, it is possible that we may not be able to complete all of the stages presented in the time line.
				<LI> We are also concerned that due to time constraints we will end up mimicking parts of other wireframe tools.
